This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

A test project website for a car parts business.


Contains 3 pages made within NextJS, for orders, parts and the landing page.

[src/app/orders - orders, src/app/parts - parts, src/app/page.tsx - landing page]

The application should demonstrate a simple and easy to use website that can easily be added on to in the future.
